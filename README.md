## SVG and CSS Animations Portfolio
Welcome to my SVG and CSS Animations Portfolio! This repository serves as a collection of all the SVG and CSS animations I create both for personal projects and professional endeavors. Here, you'll find a showcase of my skills in creating engaging and dynamic animations using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

## About
As a developer, I am quite new to animating stuff but for the last few days I had to animate quite a lot of stuff and I am loving it. In this repo, I just want to share what I do in my personal and professional projects ranging from simple transitions to complex keyframe animations, using SVG and CSS.
